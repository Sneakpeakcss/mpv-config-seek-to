# mpv-config

My personal mpv configs and user scripts :)

Nothing special, not even any fancy shaders or anything, since I only have an integrated GPU.
This is mainly just for backup and keep track of changes.

## Fonts
- [Cascadia Code](https://github.com/microsoft/cascadia-code) (OSC)
- [Manrope](https://github.com/sharanda/manrope) (Subtitles)

## User scripts
- [autosave.lua](https://gist.github.com/Hakkin/5489e511bd6c8068a0fc09304c9c5a82):
  Periodically saves "watch later" data during playback, rather than only saving on quit.

- [copyTime.lua](https://github.com/Arieleg/mpv-copyTime):
  Get the current time of the video and copy it to the clipboard with the format HH:MM:SS.MS .

- [crop.lua](https://github.com/occivink/mpv-scripts#croplua):
  Crop the video by defining the target rectangle with the cursor.

- [toggle_osc.lua](https://www.reddit.com/r/mpv/comments/ib0bo9/comment/g1v12ku):
  Cycle the OSC between the three states: `auto`, `always` and `never`.

- [seek-to.lua](https://github.com/occivink/mpv-scripts#seek-tolua):
  Seek to an absolute timestamp specified via keyboard input.

- [Thumbnailer.lua](https://github.com/deus0ww/mpv-conf):
  A more streamlined thumbnailer than [mpv_thumbnail_script](https://github.com/TheAMM/mpv_thumbnail_script), also comes with additional features.
